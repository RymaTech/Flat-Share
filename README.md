You will be sharing the two bedroom flat with me (Ryan, aged 28) and my girlfriend (Emma, aged 25). 

I am a Junior Software Developer and Emma works for an animal charity. 

We would be happy to share the flat with an individual or another couple. 

We both work rougly 9am - 5pm, Monday to Friday. When not at work we usually just chill and watch TV. Weekends we go out for drinks around London, go for walks in Hampstead or binge watch Netflix with a takeaway.

* Coding
* Watching Boxing
* Occassionally playing Xbox
